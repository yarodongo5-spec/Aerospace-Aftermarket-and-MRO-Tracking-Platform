# AeroTrace

A blockchain-powered platform for the aerospace aftermarket and MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul), enabling secure tracking of spare parts, maintenance events, and compliance verification to reduce downtime, prevent counterfeit components, and ensure adherence to global standards like FAA, EASA, and ICAO.

---

## Overview

AeroTrace consists of four main smart contracts that together form a decentralized, transparent, and efficient ecosystem for aerospace parts management and maintenance:

1. **Component Registry Contract** – Registers and tracks aircraft components throughout their lifecycle.
2. **MRO Event Log Contract** – Logs and verifies maintenance, repair, and overhaul events.
3. **Role-Based Access Contract** – Manages permissions for certified users, providers, and regulators.
4. **Oracle Integration Contract** – Connects with off-chain data sources for real-time updates and verification.

## Features

- **Secure component registration** with immutable lifecycle tracking  
- **Event logging** for repairs, inspections, and recertifications  
- **Role-based access control** to ensure only authorized parties update records  
- **Compliance verification** for regulators to audit airworthiness  
- **Counterfeit prevention** through transparent provenance chains  
- **Real-time data integration** via oracles for sensor diagnostics and status updates  
- **Downtime reduction** by streamlining MRO processes and part traceability  
- **Alignment with standards** like FAA/EASA for certified operations  
- **Extendable with IoT** for automated wear metrics and predictive maintenance

## Smart Contracts

### Component Registry Contract
- Register new aircraft components (e.g., turbine blades, avionics) with unique IDs and metadata
- Track lifecycle events like installation, removal, and ownership transfers
- Query provenance to verify authenticity and prevent counterfeits

### MRO Event Log Contract
- Log maintenance events with timestamps, details, and status codes (e.g., "repaired," "recertified")
- Automate event validation based on predefined rules and oracle inputs
- Immutable audit trails for compliance checks and historical reviews

### Role-Based Access Contract
- Assign roles (e.g., MRO provider, airline operator, regulator) with granular permissions
- Enforce access controls for updates, views, and verifications
- Revocation mechanisms for roles in case of certification changes

### Oracle Integration Contract
- Securely fetch off-chain data from trusted sources (e.g., IoT sensors, FAA databases)
- Update component status with real-time diagnostics (e.g., wear metrics)
- Verify external events like inspections or airworthiness certifications
